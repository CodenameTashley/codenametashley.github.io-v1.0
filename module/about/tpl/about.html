                <p>
                    Hello, I am Tashley Toocaram and a fresh graduate that was enrolled in a bachelor degree with honours in Applied Computing
                    at the University of Mauritius. I joined the professional world of software development as a Junior Software
                    Developer at <a href="https://www.chb-technologies.mu">CHB Technologies Ltd</a> after
                    my tertiary education.
                </p>

                <p>This small web app is about introducing me and it was developed during my free time (after winning too many
                    match in FIFA). It is also an interface to connect you guys with my different social network accounts.</p>

                <p>I was introduced in the programming world by <b>Mr. James Leong Mook Seng</b> at the age of 17 and at that
                    time I was writing codes in Pascal. And during my pre-university holidays, I developed small programs
                    using Pascal just to keep doing what I always love doing; write codes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then I joined the <a href="http://www.uom.ac.mu">University of Mauritius</a> in August 2014 to pursue
                    my studies in the Computing world. There, I was introduced to my all-time favorite programming language,
                    <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> and also other languages like PHP, JavaScript, etc.
                    <br/> Apart from the programming languages that was taught at the University, I also learned basic C#,
                    Python, C++ and Kotlin.
                </p>

                <p>In June 2015, I was in the second batch of the <b>Smart Apps Internship</b> Programme organised by Microsoft
                    Student Partners (Mauritius), HM Rawat, Ceridian and Emtel. During the 6 weeks of the programme, we were
                    given the task to create a Windows Phone App. </p>

                <p>I started my 8 months traineeship at <a href="http://www.infomil.mu">Infomil Mauritius Ltd</a> under its
                    annual programme named <b>Programme d'encadrement</b> that has the aim to provide Level 2 students of
                    universities, the opportunity to work on a project under a professional environment. It was indeed an
                    enriching experience to be surrounded by IT professionals who shared the maximum of their technical &amp;
                    non-technical skills and career tips with us.</p>

                <p>Before entering in the final year of my BSc programme, along with a classmate, we worked on a project entitled
                    <b>A Web Based Audio Learning System using Drupal</b>. The duration of this small project was also for
                    6 weeks.</p>
